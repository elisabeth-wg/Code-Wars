## Introduction 
### This repository was created to track my progress on Codewars Katas. It has also enabled me to be accountable in the daily practice of challenges, utilizing git, and GitHub. 
## Tech Stack

**Javascript**



### Optimizations
#### I would like to create a short clip demonstrating various string and array methods for Javascript. These could be demonstrated with a corresponding challenge. I would like them to be quick snapshots vs. lengthy descriptions or clips. Additionally, they would be cataloged in such a way that they would be easily accessible.
